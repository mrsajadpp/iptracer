This Python script allows you to generate a map based on the location of an IP address. It uses the `geocoder` and `folium` libraries to retrieve the location information and create an interactive map.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter an IP address.

5. The script will display a warning message and generate a map based on the location of the provided IP address.
